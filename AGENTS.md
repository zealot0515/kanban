This file captures tribal knowledge-the nuanced, non-obvious patterns that make the difference between a quick fix and hours of debugging.
When to add to this file:
- User had to intervene, correct, or hand-hold
- Multiple back-and-forth attempts were needed to get something working
- You discovered something that required reading many files to understand
- A change touched files you wouldn't have guessed
- Something worked differently than you expected
- User explicitly asks to add something
Proactively suggest additions when any of the above happen-don't wait to be asked.
What NOT to add: Stuff you can figure out from reading a few files, obvious patterns, or standard practices. This file should be high-signal, not comprehensive.

TypeScript principles
- No any types unless absolutely necessary.
- Check node_modules for external API type definitions instead of guessing.
- Prefer SDK-provided types, schemas, helpers, and model metadata over local redefinitions. For things like Cline SDK reasoning settings, use the SDK's source of truth whenever possible instead of recreating unions, support checks, or shapes in Kanban.
- NEVER use inline imports. No await import("./foo.js"), no import("pkg").Type in type positions, and no dynamic imports for types. Always use standard top-level imports.
- NEVER remove or downgrade code to fix type errors from outdated dependencies. Upgrade the dependency instead.

Code quality
- Write production-quality code, not prototypes
- Break components into small, single-responsibility files. 
- Extract shared logic into hooks and utilities. 
- Prioritize maintainability and clean architecture over speed. 
- Follow DRY principles and maintain clean architecture with clear separation of concerns.
- In `web-ui`, prefer `react-use` hooks (via `@/kanban/utils/react-use`) whenever possible
- Before adding custom utility code, evaluate whether a well-maintained third-party package can reduce complexity and long-term maintenance cost.

Architecture opinions
- Avoid thin shell wrappers that only forward props or relocate JSX for a single call site.
- Prefer extracting domain logic (state, effects, async orchestration) over presentation-only pass-through layers.
- Do not optimize for line count alone. Optimize for codebase navigability and clarity.

Git guardrails
- NEVER commit unless user asks.

GitHub issues
When reading issues:
- Always read all comments on the issue.
- Use this command to get everything in one call:
  gh issue view <number> --json title,body,comments,labels,state

When closing issues via commit:
- Include fixes #<number> or closes #<number> in the commit message. This automatically closes the issue when the commit is merged.

web-ui Stack
- Kanban web-ui uses Tailwind CSS v4 for styling, Radix UI for accessible headless primitives, and Lucide React for icons.
- Custom UI primitives live in `src/components/ui/` (button, dialog, tooltip, kbd, spinner, cn utility).
- Toast notifications use `sonner`. Import `{ toast }` from `"sonner"` or use `showAppToast` from `@/components/app-toaster`.

Styling mental model
- Use Tailwind utility classes as the primary styling system. Prefer `className` over inline `style={{}}`.
- Prefer Tailwind classes over adding custom CSS in `globals.css` when possible. Conditional Tailwind classes via `cn()` are better than CSS overrides for state-driven styling (e.g. selected/active variants). Reserve `globals.css` for things Tailwind can't express: complex selectors (sibling combinators, attribute selectors), app-level layout glue, or styles that genuinely need to cascade.
- Only use inline `style={{}}` for truly dynamic values (colors from props/variables, computed positions from drag-and-drop, runtime-dependent dimensions).
- The design system tokens are defined in `globals.css` inside `@theme { ... }`. Use Tailwind utilities that reference them: `bg-surface-0`, `text-text-primary`, `border-border`, etc.

Design tokens (defined in globals.css @theme)
- Surface hierarchy: `surface-0` (#1F2428, app bg / columns), `surface-1` (#24292E, navbar / project col / raised), `surface-2` (#2D3339, cards/inputs), `surface-3` (#353C43, hover), `surface-4` (#3E464E, pressed/scrollbars)
- Borders: `border` (#30363D, default), `border-bright` (#444C56, more visible), `border-focus` (#0084FF, focus rings)
- Text: `text-primary` (#E6EDF3), `text-secondary` (#8B949E), `text-tertiary` (#6E7681)
- Accent: `accent` (#0084FF), `accent-hover` (#339DFF)
- Status: `status-blue` (#4C9AFF), `status-green` (#3FB950), `status-orange` (#D29922), `status-red` (#F85149), `status-purple` (#A371F7), `status-gold` (#D4A72C)
- Border radius: `rounded-sm` (4px), `rounded-md` (6px), `rounded-lg` (8px), `rounded-xl` (12px)

UI primitives (src/components/ui/)
- `Button` from `@/components/ui/button`: `variant="default"|"primary"|"danger"|"ghost"`, `size="sm"|"md"`, `icon={<LucideIcon />}`, `fill`, children for text content.
- `Dialog`, `DialogHeader`, `DialogBody`, `DialogFooter` from `@/components/ui/dialog`: For modals. `DialogHeader` takes a `title` string.
- `AlertDialog`, `AlertDialogTitle`, `AlertDialogDescription`, `AlertDialogAction`, `AlertDialogCancel` from `@/components/ui/dialog`: For destructive confirmations.
- `Tooltip` from `@/components/ui/tooltip`: `<Tooltip content="text"><trigger/></Tooltip>`.
- `Spinner` from `@/components/ui/spinner`: `size` (number), `className`.
- `Kbd` from `@/components/ui/kbd`: Keyboard shortcut display.
- `cn` from `@/components/ui/cn`: Utility for conditional className joining.

Icons
- Use `lucide-react` for all icons. Import individual icons: `import { Settings, Plus, Play } from "lucide-react"`.
- Standard icon sizes: 14px for small buttons, 16px for default contexts.
- Pass icons as JSX elements to button `icon` prop: `icon={<Settings size={16} />}`.

Radix UI primitives
- Use Radix directly for headless behavior: `@radix-ui/react-popover`, `@radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu`, `@radix-ui/react-checkbox`, `@radix-ui/react-switch`, `@radix-ui/react-collapsible`, `@radix-ui/react-select`.
- Style Radix components with Tailwind classes. Use `data-[state=checked]:` for state-driven styling.

Dark theme
- The app is always in dark theme. Colors are set via CSS custom properties in `globals.css`.
- Surface hierarchy: `bg-surface-0` (app background) -> `bg-surface-1` (raised panels) -> `bg-surface-2` (cards/inputs) -> `bg-surface-3` (hover) -> `bg-surface-4` (pressed).
- Do NOT use Blueprint, Tailwind's light-mode defaults, or any `dark:` prefix. The theme is always dark.

Misc. tribal knowledge
- Kanban's native Cline agent is powered by the installed `@clinebot/core` and `@clinebot/llms` packages plus the local `src/cline-sdk/` boundary layer, so when Cline behavior is unclear, inspect those packages and `src/cline-sdk/` for the real implementation details.
- Kanban is launched from the user's shell and inherits its environment. For agent detection and task-agent startup, prefer direct PATH checks and direct process launches over spawning an interactive shell. Avoid `zsh -i`, shell fallback command discovery, or "launch shell then type command into it" on hot paths. On setups with heavy shell init like `conda` or `nvm`, doing that per task can freeze the runtime and even make new Terminal.app windows feel hung when several tasks start at once. It's fine to use an actual interactive shell for explicit shell terminals, not for normal agent session work.
- If CI hangs on Node 22 after tests seem to finish, suspect a live subprocess or SDK-host startup path before assuming a slow test body. Read `.plan/docs/node22-ci-hanging-tests-investigation.md` before repeating that investigation. `test/runtime/cline-sdk/cline-task-session-service.test.ts` was the big prior culprit because a unit-style suite was still booting the real Cline SDK host.
- When Kanban runs on a headless remote Linux instance (for example over SSH+tunnel), native folder picker commands may be unavailable (`zenity`/`kdialog`). Treat this as a normal remote-runtime limitation and use manual path entry fallback instead of requiring desktop packages.
- Launch profile schemas must stay dependency-free from `src/core/api-contract.ts`; the API contract imports them, so importing the contract back into `src/core/launch-profiles.ts` creates a runtime initialization cycle.
- Saved launch profile values are intentionally returned only as `{ name, configured }` summaries. The encrypted profile file is global to the user, while task-level environment overrides remain in the task data and are unencrypted.
- Passing `OPENAI_API_KEY` to Codex does not select a custom provider or replace ChatGPT authentication. CLIProxy launch profiles must explicitly override `model_provider`, the provider's `base_url`/`env_key`, and `requires_openai_auth=false` through argv. Keep credentials in the encrypted variables and process environment, never argv or the user's Codex config/auth files. Verify routing with a local mock Responses endpoint and dummy keys, since checking the spawned environment alone misses this failure.
- CLI arguments have explicit command and literal-line input modes. Preserve legacy `cliArgs` arrays verbatim; never shell-parse already-tokenized TOML strings. `cliArgsInput` retains editable text (including trailing newlines and unfinished quotes) until validation, and takes precedence over legacy argv. Do not use `split/filter/join` as a controlled textarea's editing state: it eats Enter/trailing newlines. Before diagnosing provider settings, verify argv grouping: a shell-style `-c 'key=value'` paste was previously passed as one argument, and bare provider assignments cause Codex's `unexpected argument` error. Manual `-c` flags can fully configure CLIProxy without the provider editor.
- Blank-prompt Start must create a real task card and open its detail view, using the normal task session/worktree/hooks path. Keep its prompt empty (a default title is display-only), preserve titled empty cards in board normalization, and suppress startup images/plan input. Do not route it to the synthetic home terminal; users need the task page to configure the CLI before their first message.
- The Cline SDK transitively installs `@openai/codex` via `ai-sdk-provider-codex-cli`, creating `node_modules/.bin/codex`. Launching the dev runtime through `npm run` prepends that directory to PATH and shadows the user's installed CLI. The custom dev shell must invoke `node scripts/dev-full.mjs` directly. In a prior macOS malware alert, system logs identified this bundled Codex, while the Homebrew binary passed signature verification; always identify the actual executable path before diagnosing the user's global installation.
